### Phonebook
This is an app that functions as a phonebook for the user. The user is able to add, view and delete contacts from a contact list stored in a database. This project uses Python, SQLite and Tkinter.

### File Transfer
This is an app that allows a user to transfer files from one directory to another. I modified this app to automatically choose files less than 24 hours old in the current directory to save the user time and increase accuracy. This project uses Python and Tkinter.

### Checkbook
This app would be a very basic bank user interface. It allows the user to create an account and add deposit and withdrawal transactions. It allows the user to view their account with all transactions on their account. This was built using the Django framework.
